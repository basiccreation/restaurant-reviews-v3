Yes, it still has all the hits â€” the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon â€”but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."

Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time."

Every inch of the massive Lower East Side space smells intensely of pastrami and rye loaves. The sandwiches are massive, so they are best when shared. Order at the counter, and don't forget to tip your slicer â€” your sandwich will be better for it."

Seriously, a bunch of meat albeit you can sample beforehand on rye/white/wheat bread. Cheese extra. Pickles free, you can just ask them at the pickup counter. But seriously 20 bucks gone for an non-flavored half sandwich. And a line that is long, especially if you want seating. I'm down to just take a quick look where Sally and Harry sat and leave to the other delis all around NYC. Oh and they accept Samsung pay."

Came here for lunch on a random weekday afternoon and when we arrived, there was a line forming already. The space is a bit cramped. You'll get to know your neighbors soon enough. The pizza is just delightful and delicious. It's a ncie plus that you get to see them firing up the pizzas in the corner. The major issue with Roberta's is the trek out to the Williamsburg/Bushwick."

Straightforward classics like smoked brisket and baby back ribs are always a strong choice, but there are also options like pork belly tacos and a lamb belly banh mi. The space is sprawling in a way that feels like the real deal, and Durney himself can usually be found working the room, and keeping a watchful eye on the smoking meats. It's counter service only, and there's often a line, but for the scene and certainly for the meat, it's easily worth the trip to Red Hook."

Ambiance is a bit industrial, good is definitely much more sophisticated than the look of the place! Ordered the superiority burger anda side of potato salad. The potato salad was very light and tasted clean ( less mayo, lots of dill and some cucumber) -- refreshing for a humid summer night! Sandwich was surprisingly delicious - it is very small ( funny allusion to a White Castle burger) but it packs a punch! Not only are there layers of flavors ( amazing sauces) but the party itself had a great texture Ahmed flavor-- well done and so wonderful! Will definitely stop by again for an overall amazing burger/sandwich. Staff was super nice and accommodating but not out of the way friendly."

Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I've ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY."

The only thing I'm bummed about right now is the consistency in what is served. The first couple of times I picked up dinner, the box was loaded with veggies, including lots of broccoli and large pieces of cabbage with other veggies to supplement. But the last two times I picked up, the box has been about 85 percent rice and the veggie medley is mostly green onions and celery with a few pieces of cabbage and 2 or 3 small pieces of broccoli. I don't really want to pay for mostly streamed rice. (I picked up around 5:30 tonight. It wasn't busy and it wasn't late so should have been plenty of real veggies in the kitchen.)",

Still, I make a point to stop by sometimes when I'm back home visiting, and the pizza still seems just as good as I remembered. This is one of a handful of restaurants I really miss living hundreds of miles away from. \n\nThe pizza might be expensive normally, but their *lunch specials* are an excellent deal (two slices of pizza and a soda for 5-6 bucks). Or at least they were last time I dropped by, which was sadly a while ago at this point; I should fix that sometime. (They've been running the same lunch special since I was a kid, though, so I doubt they've canned it.)",

Always on the lookout for good Southern food (rare in the Santa Cruz area), we decided to try this southern Creole place.\nWe got there right when it opened (11:00), and each of us grabbed the lunch special, which was $10.95 and included any Po Boy sandwich with either Cajun fries or a small stew and a drink. I opted for the fried chicken Po boy, which came with fried chicken, spicy mayo, coleslaw, pickles, and tomato, with a side of Cajun fries. My wife tried the roast beef po boy with a side of red beans and rice stew, and we also ordered a side of fried pickles. ",

The fried chicken was light and airy (not true southern style, more Cajun) and the fries were seasoned with just the right amount of spice. The veggies were fresh and had a good crunch, and complimented the chicken very well. The beef sandwich was more like chopped beef with a tangy gravy sauce and spicy mayo, and the stew was awesome and tasted homemade. The fried pickles were perfectly done, and came with a mustard sauce (think Popeyes Mardi Gras mustard, but better), which went perfectly. Came with a ton of pickles for $3.50!",

        "comments": "\nSuch a great restaurant and much needed in the not diverse enough Santa Cruz food scene. Soups were excellent as well as the house rice and beans. Had the special tostada and entomatado which had the most unbelievable verde sauce I've had in my life. It's indescribable. Wish we could have ordered the mole and the aldonbigas which are meatballs in a chipotle tomato sauce. Wait staff i.",

The food is always great, with an ever changing list of new dishes to try on daily specials.   The consistency of their regular food items on the menu.  \nStill the best burger in town in my opinion. \nAn amazing place, so thank you for being top quality in every area Cafe Cruz! Cheers!",

This was a hundred dollar meal for two. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the AMAZING hostess who reseated us outside with nothing but patience and understanding so my friend and I could hold an actual conversation. She was the only decent thing about the whole meal. I'll never go back.",
